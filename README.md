# Simple Game Engine

A simple game engine written in Typescript. Basic affordances are provided for developing an HTML canvas based game.

This is a WIP, and not currently useful except as an example of how to write simple games from scratch.

### Examples

Examples are located in the [packages](./packages/) folder.

#### Brick Pong

A very simple Arkanoid/Breakout clone.

#### Xenophobia

A space game/Galaga clone.
